This project is a random password generator.
When used, the user will be prompted to input their desired password length.
They will then be asked a series of questions to determine what types of characters they would like in their random password.
The output will be a randomized password that is the length the user desires and encorporates all the types of characters they wish and none that they don't.
This project will display the creators knowledge of javascript: functions, if/else statement, for loops, random number generators, event listeners and arrays.
